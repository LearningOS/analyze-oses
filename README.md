目前在分析的OS有
## [aero](https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer/aero)
Aero is a new modern, experimental, unix-like operating system written in Rust. Aero follows the monolithic kernel design and it is inspired by the Linux Kernel. Aero supports modern PC features such as Long Mode, 5-level paging, and SMP (multicore), to name a few.


## [theseus](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus)
