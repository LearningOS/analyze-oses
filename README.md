# analyze-oses
这个repo是用于分析各种有意思的OS的架构/模块设计思想和具体思想

注：分析者可以建立相关目录和文件来描述分析内容。欢迎感兴趣的朋友加入到分析队伍中来。

目前在分析的OS如下：
## [aero](https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer/aero)
Aero is a new modern, experimental, unix-like operating system written in Rust. Aero follows the monolithic kernel design and it is inspired by the Linux Kernel. Aero supports modern PC features such as Long Mode, 5-level paging, and SMP (multicore), to name a few.

- x86-64
- kernel module
- call stack backtrace
- network
- ext2 filesystem
- boot
- smp support
- syscall support
- ...

## [theseus](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus)
Theseus is a new OS written from scratch in Rust to experiment with novel OS structure, better state management, and how to leverage intralingual design principles to shift OS responsibilities like resource management into the compiler.

- aarch64
- x86-64
- kernel module
- call stack backtrace
